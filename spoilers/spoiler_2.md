## Ordering the letters by columns

We rotate the matrix of segment to read them by column, and we obtain this result:

```

That gives us the following strings:

### G. H. Hardy

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy

Godfrey Harold "G. H." Hardy FRS (7 February 1877 – 1 December 1947) was an English mathematician, known for his achievements in number theory and mathematical analysis.

Moreover, Hardy deliberately pointed out in his Apology that mathematicians generally do not "glory in the uselessness of their work," but rather – because science can be used for evil as well as good ends – "mathematicians may be justified in rejoicing that there is one science at any rate, and that their own, whose very remoteness from ordinary human activities should keep it gentle and clean."

Full quote:

"But science works for evil as well as for good (and particularly, of course, in time of war); and both Gauss and less mathematicians may be justified in rejoicing that there is one science at any rate, and that their own, whose very remoteness from ordinary human activities should keep it gentle and clean."

Missing part: **"that their own"** <- could it be used as a mask on the remaining code in columns mode?
